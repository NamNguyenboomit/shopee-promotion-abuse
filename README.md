# SHOPEE PROMOTION PROGRAM EXPLOITATION

## Introduction
Shopee, a prominent e-commerce platform in Vietnam, has provided data on the number of orders from several stores during a promotional campaign. During this campaign, Shopee issued vouchers offering a 30% discount with a maximum value of 20,000 VND. After 4 days of the program, the admin has observed that some customers or stores have exploited the program for personal gains. The management aims to identify these customers or stores in order to monitor their activities closely and enhance the management of the promotional campaign.

## BUYER ABUSATION
For the group of customers suspected of exploitation, the author proposes 3 metrics to identify customers with a high potential for program abuse:

1. Number of Used Promotion Codes
2. Time Interval Between Two Promotion Code Usages
3. Number of Promotion Codes Used for Special-Value Orders (within the range of 67,000 to 100,000 VND)

The author plans to categorize customers based on each metric, assigning values from 1 to 3, with 3 indicating the highest potential for exploitation. This corresponds to customers like **333, 332, and 323**, who all exhibit a high likelihood of program abuse.

## SELLER ABUSATION
For the stores, considering whether they collude with customers or exploit the program themselves, the author proposes the following metrics to identify stores with a high risk of misuse:

1. Ratio of Abnormal Revenue Increase along with Unusual Coupon Usage
2. Orders with Special-Value

For the first method, it's crucial to cross-reference across various discount programs and different periods to arrive at a more accurate conclusion.
